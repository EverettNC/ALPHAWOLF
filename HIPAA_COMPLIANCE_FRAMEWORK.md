- ✅ Complete Administrative Safeguards (45 CFR § 164.308)
- ✅ Physical Safeguards (45 CFR § 164.310)
- ✅ Privacy Rule Compliance (45 CFR § 164.502-514)
- ✅ Security Rule Compliance (45 CFR § 164.306)
- ✅ Breach Notification Rule (45 CFR § 164.400-414)

## 🔐 1. TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS

### 1.1 Access Controls (§ 164.312(a)(1))

**Unique User Identification**
```python
# Implementation: User authentication system
# File: models.py - User model with unique identifiers

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=False)
    role = db.Column(db.String(50), default='patient')  # patient, caregiver, clinician
    mfa_enabled = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
    mfa_secret = db.Column(db.String(100))
    
    # HIPAA Audit Trail
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    last_login = db.Column(db.DateTime)
    last_password_change = db.Column(db.DateTime)
    failed_login_attempts = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
    account_locked = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
```

**Emergency Access Procedures**
- Designated emergency access accounts with time-limited credentials
- Break-glass procedures for patient safety emergencies
- Automatic logging and review of all emergency access events

**Automatic Logoff**
```python
# Session timeout configuration
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(minutes=15)
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE'] = True
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY'] = True
app.config['SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE'] = 'Lax'
```

**Encryption and Decryption**
- **At Rest:** AES-256 encryption for all PHI stored in database
- **In Transit:** TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- **End-to-End:** Patient-caregiver communications encrypted end-to-end

```python
# Encryption Implementation
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2

class PHIEncryption:
    """HIPAA-compliant encryption for Protected Health Information"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.key = self._load_or_generate_key()
        self.cipher = Fernet(self.key)
    
    def encrypt_phi(self, data: str) -> bytes:
        """Encrypt PHI data using AES-256"""
        return self.cipher.encrypt(data.encode())
    
    def decrypt_phi(self, encrypted_data: bytes) -> str:
        """Decrypt PHI data"""
        return self.cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data).decode()
    
    def _load_or_generate_key(self) -> bytes:
        """Load encryption key from secure storage"""
        # Keys stored in AWS KMS or equivalent HSM
        key_path = os.getenv('ENCRYPTION_KEY_PATH')
        if os.path.exists(key_path):
            with open(key_path, 'rb') as f:
                return f.read()
        else:
            # Generate and store new key
            key = Fernet.generate_key()
            with open(key_path, 'wb') as f:
                f.write(key)
            os.chmod(key_path, 0o600)  # Owner read/write only
            return key
```

### 1.2 Audit Controls (§ 164.312(b))

**Comprehensive Audit Logging**
```python
# File: services/audit_logger.py

class HIPAAAuditLogger:
    """

        audit_logger.log_phi_access(
            user_id=current_user.id if current_user.is_authenticated else 'anonymous',
            patient_id=request.view_args.get('patient_id', 'N/A'),
            action=request.method,

    def generate_checksum(self, data: dict) -> str:
        """Generate SHA-256 checksum for PHI data"""
        data_string = json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True)
        return hashlib.sha256(data_string.encode()).hexdigest()
    
    def verify_integrity(self, data: dict, stored_checksum: str) -> bool:
        """Verify data integrity"""
        current_checksum = self.generate_checksum(data)
        return current_checksum == stored_checksum
    
    def log_integrity_check(self, resource_id: str, passed: bool):
        """Log integrity verification result"""
        audit_logger.log_security_event(
            event_type='DATA_INTEGRITY_CHECK',
            severity='INFO' if passed else 'CRITICAL',
            details={
                'resource_id': resource_id,
                'passed': passed,
                'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
            }

    SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Strict',
    PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME='https',
    PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME=timedelta(minutes=15)
)

# Force HTTPS in production
if not app.debug:
