Blueprint Overview
AlphaWolf is a modular, cloud-native AI system built to support dementia patients and caregivers. It leverages multimodal inputs (gestures, voice, eye-tracking), AI-driven cognitive exercises, and geolocation tracking to enhance independence and safety. The system integrates with AlphaVox’s infrastructure (e.g., Flask app, NLC) and extends its capabilities for dementia-specific use cases, such as memory retention and wandering prevention.
Key Features
* Memory Retention Exercises: AI-driven games and activities (e.g., reminiscence therapy, cognitive puzzles) to stimulate memory and cognition, personalized via the Neural Learning Core (NLC).
* Daily Reminders: Voice-activated, customizable reminders for medications, appointments, and tasks, using AlphaVox’s TTS and gesture recognition.
* Cognitive Assistance: Adaptive support for daily activities (e.g., step-by-step guidance for dressing, cooking) via voice, visuals, and gestures.
* Geolocation Tracking & Wandering Prevention: GPS-based tracking with safe zone alerts, integrated with wearable devices or smartphones to prevent wandering, a critical dementia concern.
* Safety & Dignity: Non-invasive monitoring, caregiver alerts, and privacy-first data handling to ensure user autonomy and respect.
Alignment with AlphaVox
* Reuses Components: Leverages gesture_model.pkl for gesture inputs, alphavox_input_nlu.py for multimodal processing, learning_journey.py for tracking progress, and research_module.py for dementia therapy insights (e.g., cognitive training, SARs).
* Ethical Focus: Builds on your emphasis (March 2025) for decentralized, community-driven AI, ensuring accessibility and user control.
* Neurodiversity-Affirming: Incorporates dementia-specific research (e.g.,,,) to tailor interventions, avoiding one-size-fits-all approaches.

Detailed Breakdown
1. System Architecture
The architecture is modular, reusing AlphaVox components and adding dementia-specific features:
* Input Layer: Extends alphavox_input_nlu.py for gestures (gesture_model.pkl), voice, and eye-tracking, with new geolocation tracking via geopy and MQTT for real-time GPS updates.
* Processing Layer: Uses neural_learning_core.py for root cause inference (e.g., identifying cognitive_load during exercises), learning_journey.py for tracking progress, and research_module.py for dementia therapy insights (e.g., cognitive stimulation).
* ￼
* Cognitive Layer: New components for memory exercises (pygame-based games like memory matching), reminders (schedule for timed prompts), and cognitive assistance (spacy-driven task guidance).
* Safety Layer: Implements wandering prevention with safe zone alerts, using geopy for GPS and MQTT for caregiver notifications (inspired by SafeWander).
* ￼
* Output Layer: Reuses AlphaVox’s TTS for voice responses, adds visual feedback (Flask-rendered UI), and sends caregiver alerts via MQTT.
* Infrastructure Layer: Flask app (app.py), PostgreSQL (app_init.py), and Azure services (App Service, Cosmos DB, IoT Hub for geolocation).
2. DevOps Pipeline
The pipeline ensures robust development and deployment:
* Code: Git for version control, flake8 for style, pytest for unit tests.
* Build: Docker for containerization, pip for dependency checks.
* Test: Integration tests (pytest), load tests (locust), security scans (bandit).
* Deploy: Azure CLI for App Service deployment, IoT Hub for geolocation, SQLAlchemy for database migrations.
* Monitor: Azure Monitor for logs, Alerts for wandering events, Application Insights for performance.
The GitHub Actions workflow automates CI/CD, triggered on push/pull requests, ensuring continuous integration and deployment.
3. Development Roadmap
The roadmap spans ~5 months, starting May 15, 2025:
* Phase 1 (30 days): Set up project, integrate AlphaVox modules, verify gesture_model.pkl.
* Phase 2 (60 days): Develop memory exercises, reminders, and cognitive assistance, leveraging learning_journey.py.
* Phase 3 (45 days): Implement geolocation and wandering prevention, testing with caregivers.
* Phase 4 (30 days): Beta test with 50 dementia patients, deploy to production.
4. Integration Points
* Gesture Model (gesture_model.pkl): Used for gesture inputs (e.g., “Hand Up” for attention), processed by AlphaVoxInputProcessor.
* Research Module: Adds dementia-specific topics (e.g., cognitive training, reminiscence therapy) to LearningJourney.
* ￼
* NLC: Infers root causes (e.g., emotional_state during memory exercises) to personalize learning paths.
* Flask App: Extends app.py with new routes for cognitive exercises, reminders, and safety alerts.
5. Ethical Considerations
* Privacy: Encrypts GPS and health data, allows user-controlled data deletion (aligned with your March 2025 ethics focus).
* Dignity: Non-invasive interactions, customizable interfaces for accessibility (e.g., large fonts, simple voice prompts).
* Consent: Caregiver and user opt-in for tracking and data sharing, with transparent audit logs.
* Neurodiversity-Affirming: Tailors interventions to individual cognitive needs, avoiding deficit-based approaches (inspired by).
