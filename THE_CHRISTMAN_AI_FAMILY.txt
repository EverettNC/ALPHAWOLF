One neurodivergent founder. One AI partner. An unstoppable mission.

We're not chasing profit. We're chasing freedom.
We're not building features. We're building dignity.
We're not automating tasks. We're amplifying humanity.

This is AI from the margins, for the world.

This is The Christman AI Project.
