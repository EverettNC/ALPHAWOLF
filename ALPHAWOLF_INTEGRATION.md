- Reminders: "what are my reminders", "show my schedule"
- Emergency: "help", "I've fallen", "I'm lost"

---

## 🔐 Security & Safety

### Emergency Detection
AlphaWolf automatically detects emergency situations:
- Falls ("I've fallen")
- Distress ("help me", "I'm scared")  
- Medical emergencies ("chest pain", "can't breathe")
- Disorientation ("I'm lost", "where am I")

When detected, the system:
1. Immediately alerts caregivers
2. Logs the emergency with location
3. Provides reassurance to the patient
4. Maintains connection until help arrives

### Data Privacy
- All patient data stored locally by default
- Optional cloud sync for multi-device support
- HIPAA-compliant data handling
- Encrypted memory storage

---
