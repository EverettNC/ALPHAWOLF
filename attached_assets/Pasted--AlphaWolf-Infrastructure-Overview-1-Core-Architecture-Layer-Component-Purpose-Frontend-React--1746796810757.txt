🏗️ AlphaWolf Infrastructure Overview
✅ 1. Core Architecture
Layer	Component	Purpose
Frontend	React (Next.js or standard), HTML5/CSS3	Responsive dashboard for caregivers & family
Backend	Flask (Python)	API layer for voice commands, GPS, mood tracking, games
Database	PostgreSQL (via NeonDB or Supabase)	Store routines, user history, profiles, emotional trends
AI Services	Modular Python microservices	Mood detection, adaptive game engine, AI reminders
Geofencing	GPS + Geocoding API (Google or OpenStreetMap)	Monitors boundaries and triggers alerts
Realtime Alerts	Firebase or Socket.IO	Push alerts to caregivers (wander alerts, mood spikes)
Wearable Sync	REST / BLE integration	Biometric sync (heart rate, steps, stress, etc.)
Voice & Audio	ElevenLabs / Whisper / local fallback	Interactive spoken responses, reminders, commands

📦 2. Deployment Stack
* Dev Environment: Replit or GitHub Codespaces (Flask + Python 3.11)
* Staging & Production: Railway / Render / Fly.io (auto deploy from main)
* Containerization: Docker (optional, for clinics or devices)
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions + CodeQL + Pytest
* Monitoring: Sentry for errors + UptimeRobot or Grafana for performance
