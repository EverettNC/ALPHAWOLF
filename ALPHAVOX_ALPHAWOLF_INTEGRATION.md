### The 2:32 AM Story (Extended)

**Part 1: The Voice (AlphaVox)**
12-year-old boy, nonverbal his whole life, 36 hours with AlphaVox, 2:32 AM: "I love you."

**Part 2: The Memory (AlphaWolf)**
Six months later, grandmother with Alzheimer's. She can't remember his name, but AlphaWolf shows her Memory Lane: photos of the boy, his voice saying "I love you Grandma," timeline of their life together.

She smiles: "I remember you."

**Both systems working together. Preserving voice AND memory. Past AND present.**
