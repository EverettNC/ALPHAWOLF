- **Weeks 3-4**: Performance optimizations (Lambda@Edge, RDS Proxy)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Multi-region resilience and voice personalization
- **Weeks 7-8**: Context-aware alerting and security implementations
- **Weeks 9-10**: Symbol board optimization and PII protection
- **Weeks 11-12**: Final testing, documentation, and deployment

## 🙏 The Mission

AlphaWolf isn't just technology; it's a movement to amplify human connection and dignity. 

When a 12-year-old can tell their father "I love you" through AlphaVox's communication tools, or when an Alzheimer's patient can feel secure in their environment through AlphaWolf's protection features, we've created more than software—we've enabled moments of profound human connection.

Our mission: **To use AI not for profit, but for real-world impact** that transforms lives and preserves dignity.
