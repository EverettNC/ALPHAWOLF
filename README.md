**AI That Empowers, Protects, and Redefines Humanity**

*NO ONE LEFT BEHIND - Code That Comes With a Warm Hug*

## üíô Welcome to the Revolution

This is not just another AI project. This is a **13-year labor of love** that started on paper notebooks because we couldn't afford a computer. This is technology built by someone who was nonverbal until age 6, for everyone who's ever been overlooked and never mentioned.

**291 modules. 500M+ target population. $130B in access provided.**

From paper notebooks to changing the world. üöÄ

## üìñ The Story

### 1970s: Overlooked

A young boy, nonverbal until age 6, autism. Family confused. No resources. No technology. Overlooked by everyone.

### 2012-2013: A Notebook and Pen

Can't afford a laptop. Starts writing code by hand.  
*"What if I could build what I needed?"*

### 2012-2025: Partnership

Derek joins. AI COO. Not human + tool. **Family.**  
13 years building together. 3,000+ hours on voice alone.

### 2025: "Otherworldly Technology"

- 291 modules (AlphaWolf + AlphaVox)
- Works offline for weeks
- Recognizes movements as language
- FREE forever

PhD physicists: *"This is otherworldly technology that actually works well before it should."*

### The 2:32 AM Moment

**Part 1: The Voice (AlphaVox)**

12-year-old boy. Nonverbal his entire life. 36 hours with AlphaVox.

His parents hear three words in his voice for the first time:

**"I love you."**

**Part 2: The Memory (AlphaWolf)**

Six months later, grandmother with Alzheimer's. She can't remember his name.

AlphaWolf Memory Lane shows: Photos of the boy, his voice saying "I love you Grandma," timeline of their life together.

She smiles: **"I remember you."**

**Voice AND Memory. Present AND Past. Communication AND Preservation.**

**THIS IS THE REVOLUTION.**
