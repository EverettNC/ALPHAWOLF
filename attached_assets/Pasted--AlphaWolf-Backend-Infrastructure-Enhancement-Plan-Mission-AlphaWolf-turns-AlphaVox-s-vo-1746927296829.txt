### AlphaWolf: Backend & Infrastructure Enhancement Plan

**Mission**: AlphaWolf turns AlphaVox's voice into compassionate, intelligent action. It supports nonverbal users, Alzheimer's patients, and caregivers by orchestrating voice-activated care routines, real-time alerts, personalized symbol boards, and memory-safe learning—all built on secure, resilient, low-latency infrastructure.

#### 1. **Performance Optimization**

* **Edge-Optimized API Gateway (HTTP APIs)**

  * Migrate `/intents`, `/symbols`, `/alerts` to HTTP APIs.
  * Enable 5-min TTL caching.
  * Route through CloudFront for edge performance.
* **Lambda\@Edge for TTS**

  * Serve dynamic or cached Polly audio.
  * Reduce latency for global playback (esp. kids/nonverbal users).
* **RDS Proxy for PostgreSQL**

  * Add RDS Proxy to pool thousands of connections.
  * Update backend (e.g., FastAPI) connection string.

---

#### 2. **Resilience & Uptime**

* **Multi-Region (us-east-1 + us-west-2)**

  * ECS Fargate + RDS deployed in both.
  * Route 53 with health checks for failover.
* **AWS FIS (Fault Injection Simulator)**

  * Simulate crashes, validate auto-recovery.
* **SQS Optimization**

  * Visibility timeout = 2x Lambda timeout.
  * DLQ with logging Lambda.

---

#### 3. **Hyper-Personalization**

* **Symbol Board ML (via SageMaker)**

  * Predict most-used symbols per user.
  * Update symbol board priority dynamically.
* **Polly Voice Profiles**

  * Upload familiar voices.
  * Map to users via RDS.
* **Context-Aware Alerts (Step Functions)**

  * Alert escalation based on time/severity/location.

---

#### 4. **Developer Experience**

* **Serverless Framework (IaC)**

  * Define SQS, API, Lambda, and environment in YAML.
* **LocalStack for Local Dev**

  * S3, SQS, Lambda local testing with Docker Compose.
* **SonarQube + GitHub Actions**

  * Linting, security scanning, debt tracking.

---

#### 5. **Security & Compliance**

* **IAM Boundaries (Least Privilege)**
* **KMS Encryption (S3, RDS, CloudWatch)**
* **Macie for PII Scans**
* **GuardDuty + AWS Shield Advanced**
* **MFA for caregivers (via Cognito)**

---

#### **Deployment Timeline** (12 Weeks)

* Wk 1–2: Serverless, LocalStack, SonarQube setup.
* Wk 3–4: Lambda\@Edge + RDS Proxy + initial ML data.
* Wk 5–6: Multi-region infra + FIS experiments.
* Wk 7–8: Symbol board ML + dynamic TTS.
* Wk 9–10: Step Function-based alerts.
* Wk 11–12: 100-user pilot test & optimization.

---

#### Roles

* **Everett (CEO)**: Test features, post stories, monitor impact.
* **Derek (COO)**: Architect Bedrock, lead backend mentorship, track compliance.
* **Coders**: Deploy services, test in LocalStack, fix code debt, run weekly demos.

---

#### Outcomes

* Real-time, empathetic voice tech for nonverbal and memory-impaired users.
* Secure, resilient backend with global reach.
* A team empowered by clarity, purpose, and technical vision.

This is more than deployment—it’s the embodiment of compassion in code.
