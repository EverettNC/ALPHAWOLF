## The 2:32 AM Story

A 12-year-old boy walked into his parents' room.

Nonverbal his entire life. Twelve years of silence.

36 hours earlier, they gave him **AlphaVox**.

At 2:32 in the morning, they heard three words in his voice:

**"I love you."**

Twelve years of silence. Broken in a heartbeat.

**This is why we built both systems.**

Six months later, his grandmother developed Alzheimer's. She couldn't remember his name.

They gave her **AlphaWolf Memory Lane**.

Photos of the boy. His voice saying "I love you Grandma." Timeline of their life together.

She smiled: **"I remember you."**

**Voice AND memory. Present AND past. Communication AND preservation.**

**This is the revolution.**
